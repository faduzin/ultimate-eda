# Ultimate EDA Comparison

Comparing exploratory data analysis (EDA) across different tools—Excel, Power BI, Python, and SQL—can be both meaningful and instructional. Each tool has its own advantages, limitations, and “style” of data manipulation and visualization, so creating one end-to-end project that highlights these differences is a great way to deepen your understanding and showcase your versatility. 

# Progress till now:

- Started watching videos about EDA in Excel but realized my basics are lacking, so I'll be studying statistics first.

Below are some suggestions on **why** this is a worthwhile project and **how** to approach it, followed by recommended datasets:

## Why This Project is Meaningful

1. **Tool Comparison**  
   - **Excel**: Great for quick data exploration, pivot tables, and straightforward visualizations. However, it can become unwieldy with larger datasets or complex transformations.  
   - **Power BI**: Ideal for interactive dashboards and sharing insights. Allows more sophisticated data modeling and can handle relatively large datasets.  
   - **Python**: Offers extensive libraries for data manipulation (pandas, NumPy) and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly). It’s the go-to for scripting, automation, and more advanced statistical analysis.  
   - **SQL**: Excellent for extracting and aggregating data directly from relational databases. Good for understanding how to manipulate data at the source and handle large datasets efficiently.

2. **Demonstrate Different Workflows**  
   - The workflows in these tools differ significantly. For instance, Excel relies heavily on a GUI approach (though you can use Power Query and macros), while Python/SQL rely on code-based transformations. Power BI sits in between, offering a point-and-click interface but still allowing Power Query “M” transformations and DAX calculations.  

3. **Highlight Strengths and Weaknesses**  
   - By walking through identical EDA steps, you can illustrate each tool’s unique value: ease of use, performance, level of detail, visual output, etc.

4. **Impress Employers/Peers**  
   - Showing you’re proficient across multiple platforms demonstrates flexibility and adaptability—both prized skills for data analysts, data scientists, and business intelligence professionals.

## How to Structure the Project

1. **Common EDA Steps**  
   Whatever dataset you choose, plan to execute the same core EDA steps in each tool for an apples-to-apples comparison:  
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values, data types)  
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)  
   - Exploratory visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts)  
   - Basic data transformations (grouping, pivot tables, joins/merges in SQL)

2. **Documentation**  
   - For each tool, clearly document the process. Screenshots or short code snippets are helpful.  
   - Summarize time taken, complexity of steps, and any unique gotchas encountered in each environment.

3. **Insights & Conclusions**  
   - Once EDA is complete, highlight any interesting findings about the dataset itself.  
   - Provide a reflective conclusion on which tool felt most intuitive for each step, which was fastest, which gave you the most flexibility, etc.

## Recommended Datasets

Look for a dataset that is:
- Not too large (so Excel and Power BI can handle it without too much difficulty).  
- Rich enough in columns/features to do interesting exploration (categorical, numerical, maybe some text variables).  
- Publicly available and doesn’t require complicated cleaning to get started (so you can focus on the EDA rather than heavy data wrangling, unless you explicitly want to emphasize cleaning).

### 1. [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)  
- **Pros**: Very well-known, small in size, and straightforward. Good for demonstrating simple transformations, missing data handling, and basic visualizations.  
- **Cons**: It’s used so frequently that it may feel overdone.

### 2. [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- **Pros**: Classic dataset for classification, small and easy to handle. Good for fundamental EDA.  
- **Cons**: May be too small and not very “real-world.”

### 3. [Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon)  
- **Pros**: Medium complexity with multiple numeric and categorical features (types, stats, generations). A fun dataset for demonstration.  
- **Cons**: Niche topic; depends on your audience.

### 4. [IMDB or Movie Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Pros**: Rich with categorical, numerical, and textual data. You can do genre-based analysis, look at ratings over time, etc.  
- **Cons**: Some cleaning may be required, but it’s not too complicated.

### 5. [COVID-19 Datasets](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)  
- **Pros**: Timely, wide range of analyses possible (cases by region, trends over time, etc.).  
- **Cons**: Potentially large and might have multiple sources requiring merges. Also can be sensitive or political in some contexts.

### 6. [US Flights Dataset (Bureau of Transportation Statistics)](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays)  
- **Pros**: Rich, real-world dataset with numerous features (airlines, delays, times, airports, etc.). Great for grouping and pivoting.  
- **Cons**: Larger dataset that may strain Excel; you may need to use a subset.  

### 7. [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)  
- **Pros**: A variety of curated datasets of different sizes and domains. You can pick something that aligns with your interests.  
- **Cons**: Some are very clean and small, while others might require advanced cleaning.

## Practical Tips

- **Data Size**: Make sure the dataset is **not** so large that Excel struggles. If you want to highlight performance differences, a moderately sized dataset (5k–50k rows) is good.  
- **Consistency**: Use the **same data transformations** in each tool, so you have a direct comparison.  
- **Visualization**: Try to reproduce at least a few of the same charts (e.g., bar chart, scatter plot) in each environment to show differences in how you create or modify visual elements.  
- **SQL Setup**: You can import your dataset into a local SQL database (like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) for the SQL portion.  
- **Automation**: In Python, you might show how easy it is to automate repeated analyses or create reusable scripts. Meanwhile, in Excel or Power BI, mention the possibilities of macros or scheduled refreshes.

## Final Thoughts

Yes, this project is definitely **worthwhile** and will not only sharpen your technical skills but also help you understand how each tool fits into the broader data analytics ecosystem. When you present your findings—whether on a personal blog, GitHub repository, or portfolio site—emphasize **why** you chose certain approaches in each tool and **what** you learned about the dataset. 

Good luck, and have fun exploring your dataset from multiple angles!
